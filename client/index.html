		<p><b>Tilemap Town</b> is a platform where you can build maps with your friends and roleplay and chat in the worlds you have created. It takes inspiration from BYOND "building games" that used to be popular long ago, as well as from MUCKs, Second Life, Pony Town, and other platforms.</p>

		<p>You can explore a big world, and change tiles on it to build something nice and leave your mark on it. If you register an account (not required) you can make your own personal map or upload your own custom graphics for characters and map tiles. Want to help? <a href="https://novasquirrel.com/contact.html">Get in touch!</a> 

		<p><a href="world.html" class="join">Come visit the world!</a><a href="touch_ui.html" class="join_touch">Come visit the world!</a><noscript><br>Though maybe not with this browser, because the web client requires JavaScript.</noscript></p>

		<p>The web client will also work offline; you can work on maps privately and save them to your device.</p>

		<p>In <b>Tilemap Town</b>, you can wander around a top-down 2D pixel art world, and you can play as any character you like, as long as you can draw or find a 32x32 sprite of them! There is support for multiple directions and simple animation, and <a href="https://tilemap.town/help/tutorials">there's a guide on the tutorials page</a> that explains how custom player graphics works; for the most part you just grab a template and fill it in.</p>

		<p>Tilemap Town's world consists of maps, which are 2D grids of tiles that can be modified by players, letting them collaboratively make a world together. If you register then you can even create your own maps. You can restrict building to yourself only, limit entry to specific users, and have a private space if you would like one.</p>

		Map features:
		<ul>
		<li>You can use your own graphics for the tiles you draw onto maps!</li>
		<li>Small amount of space to upload your own graphics and music to</li>
		<li>Tons of premade tiles available to build with</li>
		<li>Autotiling and animation support</li>
		<li>Can click and edit the properties of tiles directly on the map</li>
		<li>Place objects in the world to act as props</li>
		<li>Maps can be linked to each other, so that you can pass over the edge of one and end up on another, to make a big connected world</li>
		</ul>

		Chat features:
		<ul>
		<li>BBCode for chat messages, with support for multiple lines of text</li>
		<li>Helpful commands like dice rolls and teleport requests</li>
		<li>Multiple commands to help with roleplaying: <kbd>/me</kbd> <kbd>/ooc</kbd> <kbd>/spoof</kbd></li>
		<li>Tries to gracefully handle momentarily losing connection to the server; sent messages and commands should reach their destination once and only once</li>
		</ul>

		Other features:
		<ul>
		<li>An inventory system, allowing you to hold onto objects and keep notes for yourself</li>
		<li>A simple mail feature (and private messages sent to offline users will be held until they're online)</li>
		<li>A profile feature where you can write about yourself</li>
		<li>Save multiple characters and swap between them easily with commands</li>
		</ul>

		Some advanced features:
		<ul>
		<li>Scripting with the <a href="https://luau.org/">Luau</a> language (which requires a permission given by the admin) - see <a href="https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/TilemapTownScriptingService/tree/main/docs">the scripting documentation</a></li>
		<li>Documented protocol, with an open source client and server</li>
		<li>An elaborate permission system, including the ability to grant permissions to someone temporarily</li>
		<li>Features intended to make bots easier, where you can remotely interact with other maps (if granted permission to)</li>
		<li>There's support to let bots and scripts run their own little minigames directly on the map, with their own screens you can click on</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="tabcontent" id="Community">
		<h1 class="tab-fallback-heading">Community</h1>
		<p>There is an official server that's been running since 2017, and it's not especially lively (yet!) but there is quite a lot to explore. You're welcome to come visit and check it out, and even leave your own mark on the world by building something nice if you like. The official server is the default one on <a href="world.html">the web client</a>!</p>

		<p>The community is pro-LGBT+ and is meant to be a safe space to hang out. Be kind to the other people you meet here. Note that it's not really intended to be a space for kids.</p>

		<p>There's also a small <a href="https://discord.gg/N2Eqj2H">Discord server</a> for Tilemap Town and other projects I work on, but like Tilemap Town you should keep in mind that it is meant to be a SFW environment for adults. You can chat with other people interested in Tilemap Town and plan out events/hangouts. You can also get updates about what's been going on through <a href="https://blog.novasquirrel.com/tilemap-town">the Tilemap Town blog</a>, which has RSS and Atom feeds available.</p>

		<p>If you prefer forums, you can post about Tilemap Town <a href="https://crittertime.fun/viewtopic.php?t=282">here</a>. I can give Tilemap Town its own forum if there's demand and people would actually use it.</p>

		<h4>Roleplay setting</h4>

		<p>The official server is intended to be a SFW furry roleplay space, like MUCKs usually are, but you're welcome to just hang out and chat if that's more your thing! I think it would be interesting to really embrace the nature of the platform, and treat it in-character as a digital world where it's especially easy to shape the land to your wishes and build things.</p>
		<p>The world is sort of a crossroads where characters from lots of other worlds meet up, sometimes because they had to leave home for whatever reason and needed a place to go, like Traverse Town. Fantasy elements and magic are encouraged too, and the tone is supposed to be lighthearted. Explore the world, introduce people to your character, and add your own (literal) worldbuilding.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="tabcontent" id="OpenPlatform">
		<h1 class="tab-fallback-heading">Open platform</h1>
		<p>Tilemap Town is an open source project, and you can find the web client, server, and documentation <a href="https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/TilemapTown">on GitHub</a>. Anyone can host their own server or make their own client, or customize the official server or client to their liking. It could even be a good head start if you're trying to make your own online game.</p>

		<p>The server is written in Python, so it's a lot easier to extend and change than the old MUCK codebases from the 90s. The database is SQLite so there's no setup, and you can use preexisting tools to browse and interface with the database.</p>

		<p>Tilemap Town is designed with making your own clients and bots in mind, and that's encouraged! <a href="https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/TilemapTown/blob/main/docs/protocol.txt">The protocol</a> is built on top of WebSockets and JSON, which most languages should be able to use without too much trouble, and there's advice in the documentation about what a useful subset of the protocol would be. It's designed with the idea of <em>progressive enhancement</em> and is meant to work well with a minimal client, while allowing more advanced clients to have access to fancy features.</p>

		<p>In a way, Tilemap Town is sort of like IRC, in that it's decentralized and easy to connect to and interface with, but its design incorporates some modern features and leaves room for things like metadata and longer messages without needing that stuff to be in the form of extensions.</p>

		<p>There's also <a href="https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/TilemapTown/blob/main/docs/api.txt">a simple HTTP API</a> you can hit to find out some basic information about who's currently online. The official server has its API exposed <a href="https://novasquirrel.com/townapi/v1/town_info">here</a>.<br>(You can opt out of showing up on this with <kbd>/userflags add hide_api</kbd>)</p>

		<h4>Some projects that interface with Tilemap Town</h4>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/TilemapTown3DS">3DS client</a>, which is pretty minimal and allows you to move and chat. Currently kind of crashy! Written in C++ and could be a good base for another client.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/TilemapTown2MU">MU* gateway</a>, which allows you to connect through a MU* client. It allows you to use commands to view a "graphical" version of the map made out of text, and is really mostly a proof of concept.</li>
		<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/NovaSquirrel/39d72c1fe79f5c7bb68166b66f82df19">Example bot</a> that implements a very small portion of the protocol, enough to receive and respond to messages.</li>
		</ul>
