A long time ago, [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) was pretty popular and a pretty common genre was the "building game" which was probably the easiest thing to make. It was mostly just a chat that had a map attached to it that players could freely build on.

The best game in this genre was [Icon Ultima](www.byond.com/games/enigmaster2002/iconultima) and it brought me lots of years of enjoyment before it finally died. This is pretty much a recreation of that game as an HTML5 web application, and it's Free Software. It will expand on the idea of a building game and also focus on using the world that was collaboratively constructed for roleplay.

Python server
-------------
Just run `server.py` with your Python 3 interpreter, after installing [the websockets library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/websockets).
