value           - text    - the value

current items:

---ENTITY--- (generic entity that can exist on a map, which can contain more information in other tables)
General:
	id              * integer - entity ID
	owner_id        - integer - owner user ID
	creator_id      - integer - creator user ID
	created_at      -timestamp- time the entity was created 
	acquired_at     -timestamp- time the owner was changed
	type            - integer - type, also may suggest a table to look in
		0 none
		1 user       (USER table)
		2 map        (MAP table)
		3 group      (GROUP_MEMBER table)
		4 text       (stores text, possibly a script. like notecards)
		5 image      (links to a .png)
		6 map_tile   (template for a tile that can be placed on a map)
		7 tileset    (stores a description of the tiles in a tileset)
		8 reference  (refer to another entity)
		9 folder     (for categorization; holds any number of other assets)
		10 landmark  (holds a location and provides the ability to quickly teleport to it)
		11 generic   (generic entity, used for things like props or puppets)

	name            - text    - name (for display and disambiguation purposes, not to persistently identify a specific entity)
	desc            - text    - description of the entity
	pic             - text    - JSON describing the appearance - usually [tileset, x, y] or [url, 0, 0]. If null, a default is used.

	flags           - integer - generic flags field
		0x0001 don't load this entity when the container loads (unimplemented)
		0x0002 this entity is public, and can be searched for (unimplemented)

	tags            - text    - metadata tags in JSON format, like species, pronouns, etc.

	data            - text    - data associated with the object, or NULL if not applicable.
								takes advantage of SQLite being able to store text in an integer column
								----
								text: the text being stored
							   image: path to the image, added to the server's base asset url?
							  object: JSON object repesenting object information?
							 tileset: JSON array alternating between tile id and compacted tile data
						   reference: asset number it's a reference to
							  folder: ?
							landmark: map ID, x, y
	compressed_data - blob    - data that has been compressed, where the original "data" field now specifies what compression algorithm is used.
							Currently the only compression algorithm available is "zlib"

Position:
	location        - integer - entity ID of whatever contains this entity - may be a map
	position        - text    - JSON position within the container. Usually [x,y] or [x,y,dir] but it's flexible

Home position:
	home_location   - integer - entity ID of whatever is this entity's home location
	home_position   - text    - JSON position within the container. Usually [x,y] or [x,y,dir] but it's flexible

Permissions:
	allow           - integer - default permissions to allow
	deny            - integer - default permissions to deny
	guest_deny      - integer - default permissions to deny for guests

	Values:

		0x0002 build (or "modify" for things other than maps)
		0x0004 full sandbox (anyone can delete anything)
		0x0008 map admin (can do things that otherwise only map owners can, like kick or ban, but not things that are truly owner only)
		0x0010 make copies of this entity
		0x0020 map bot (can operate on map remotely)
		0x0040 move this entity within the container
		0x0080 move this entity onto another map
		0x0100 for maps: bulk build (can use the BLK command)
		       for groups: anyone can get a list of the members
		0x0200 allowed to bring non-player entities here temporarily
		0x0400 allowed to bring non-player entities here that can be here without the player's owner
